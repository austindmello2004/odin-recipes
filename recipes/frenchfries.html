    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        French fries are a universally loved snack made from potatoes cut into thin strips and fried until they 
        reach a perfect balance of crispiness and tenderness. When cooked properly, the outside becomes golden and 
        crunchy while the inside stays soft and fluffy, creating the signature texture that makes fries irresistible. 
        Their mild, comforting flavor makes them easy to pair with all kinds of seasonings and sauces.

        Beyond their classic salted form, French fries are incredibly versatile. They can be seasoned with anything 
        from garlic and herbs to spicy paprika or Cajun blends. Some are twice-fried for extra crispiness, while 
        others are baked or air-fried for a lighter touch. Whether served alongside burgers, sandwiches, or enjoyed 
        alone with dipping sauces like ketchup, mayo, or aioli, French fries remain one of the most popular and 
        universally enjoyed comfort foods.
