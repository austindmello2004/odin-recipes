        <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        A burger is a hearty, satisfying creation built around a juicy patty, most often made from seasoned ground 
        beef. When cooked to perfection—whether grilled, pan-seared, or griddled—the patty develops a flavorful 
        crust while remaining tender inside. Nestled in a soft, toasted bun, the warm meat contrasts beautifully with 
        cool, crisp vegetables like lettuce, tomatoes, and onions, creating a balance of textures and temperatures 
        that make every bite enjoyable.

        What makes burgers truly special is their endless versatility. Classic versions stick to cheese, pickles, 
        and simple condiments like ketchup and mustard, while gourmet variations introduce unique twists such as 
        bacon, sautéed mushrooms, specialty cheeses, or spicy sauces. With countless combinations of buns, toppings, 
        and flavors, a burger can be as simple or adventurous as you want, making it a beloved comfort food around 
        the world.
